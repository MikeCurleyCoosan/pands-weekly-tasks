### ***Week 01 - Hello World***

The Hello World program is a traditional first step when learing a new programming language. It allows us to confirm that we have downloaded and setup the tools that we will require over the duration of the course of study, such as cmder and VScode. We created a simple program called helloWorld.py, which basically output the words "Hello World" in the terminal window once the program was run.
